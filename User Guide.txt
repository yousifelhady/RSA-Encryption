This is a C++ console program.
The program starts with a black window and ask user to enter 3 consecutive values (P, Q, E)
where P and Q are used to determine the value of N and Phi
where N = P*Q and Phi = (P-1)*(Q-1)
E is the public key of encryption

Then, the program compute internally the value of N and Phi and D
where D = E^-1 mod Phi

Then the program ask user to enter one of the following commands:
1. IsPPrime: checks whether the entered value of P is prime or not
2. IsQPrime: check whether the entered value of Q is prime or not
3. PrintN: print the value of N
4. PrintPhi: print the value of Phi
5. PrintD: print the value of D
6. EncryptPublic=<message_to_be_encrypted>: encrypt the message between <> and print its cipher using the public key "E"
7. EncryptPrivate=<message_to_be_encrypted>: encrypt the message between <> and print its cipher using the private key "D"
8. Quit: terminate the program

Note that, the program is case sensitive. i.e.: the commands should be entered with upper and lower case letters and written.

Note on RSA:
RSA is an encryption technique used to deal with big numbers (512 bits and more).
